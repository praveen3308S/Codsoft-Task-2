   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the game**:
   ```bash
   python runner.py
   ```

## How to Play

1. **Choose Your Symbol**: Select X or O from the main menu
2. **Select Difficulty**: Choose from Easy, Medium, Hard, or Impossible
3. **Make Your Move**: Click on any empty cell to place your symbol
4. **Win Condition**: Get three symbols in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)

### Controls
- **R**: Reset current game
- **H**: Toggle hint mode (shows best moves)
- **S**: Toggle game statistics panel
- **I**: Toggle AI analysis information

## AI Difficulty Levels

| Level | Description | Strategy |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Easy** | Beginner-friendly | 30% random moves, limited depth search |
| **Medium** | Moderate challenge | 15% suboptimal moves, moderate depth |
| **Hard** | Advanced play | 5% suboptimal moves, high depth search |
| **Impossible** | Perfect play | Full minimax with alpha-beta pruning |

## Technical Implementation

### Minimax Algorithm
The AI uses the minimax algorithm to evaluate all possible game states and choose the optimal move. The algorithm:
- Explores all possible future moves
- Assigns scores to terminal states (+1 for AI win, -1 for player win, 0 for tie)
- Maximizes AI advantage while minimizing player advantage

### Alpha-Beta Pruning
Optimization technique that:
- Reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree
- Maintains the same result as standard minimax
- Significantly improves performance for deeper searches

### Performance Metrics
The game tracks and displays:
- **Nodes Explored**: Total game states evaluated
- **Computation Time**: Time taken for AI decision
- **Pruning Count**: Number of branches eliminated
- **Search Depth**: Maximum depth reached in game tree
